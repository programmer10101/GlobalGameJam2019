A work in progress... this game will be a tower defense game that uses delayed explosions (bombs with varying fuse lengths / wait times before going 'boom'). Enemies currently follow a path up to your home. A queue of bombs to come is displayed vertically on the left, and armed bombs that will be placed on the map are displayed horizontally on the bottom of the screen. 

TODO:
Drag-n-drop of bombs onto map.
Once a bomb is released, its countdown begins.
Bombs inflict max damage on enemies of same color, lesser damage to enemies of different color.
Show score.
